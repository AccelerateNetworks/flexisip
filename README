Flexisip is general purpose SIP proxy with media capabilities.
It is released under the AGPLv3 or later. Please understand the terms of AGPLv3 in COPYING before deploying it.

Documentation
---------------------

You will find a comprehensive documentation on how to use Flexisip online 
here: https://wiki.linphone.org/xwiki/wiki/public/view/Flexisip/

Compilation on GNU/Linux
------------------------

Flexisip depends on the following required externals:
- net-snmp
- hiredis
- protobuf
- xsd (>= 4, for old OS on which this version isn't packaged, rpm and deb 
  are available here: http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/xsd/download.xhtml)
- pdflatex to generate the documentation in PDF format.
- xercesc3 

You can issue ./prepare.py  -lf to specify these up.

Alternatively, provided that ortp, bctoolbox and sofia-sip dependencies are installed on the system, flexisip's cmake
integration can be used directly, for example:

cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/belledonne-communications -DSYSCONF_INSTALL_DIR=/etc


RPM generation on GNU/Linux
---------------------------
./prepare.py flexisip-rpm
make

cmake/Xcode under macosx
------------------------

To compile, with cmake/Xcode, first update submodule using:
- ./prepare.py -G Xcode flexisip \
	-DENABLE_REDIS=NO \
	-DEP_sofiasip_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS=PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/local/lib/pkgconfig/ 
- xcodebuild -project WORK/flexisip/cmake/Project.xcodeproj/ 
- open WORK/flexisip/Build/flexisip/flexisip.xcodeproj

Compile with soci on macOs
---------------------

To compile with soci on macOS you need to install and unlink mysql :
brew install mysql
brew unlink mysql
Then install mysql-connector-c
brew install mysql-connector-c
And finally install soci with mysql
brew install soci --with-mysql

You can now use -DENABLE_SOCI=ON in your prepare options.

Configuration
---------------------

Flexisip needs a configuration file for running correctly.
You can either:
- copy and modify file flexisip.conf.sample to flexisip.conf in directory <prefix>/etc/flexisip
- or issue `flexisip --dump-default all > flexisip.conf` in a terminal 
  to generate a configuration file with the default values.

Developer notes:
---------------------

With sofia-sip, you have the choice between msg_dup and msg_copy,
sip_from_dup and sip_from_copy etc...
The difference isn't well documented in sofia-sip documentation.
However it is important to understand that
*_copy() just makes a copy of the structure, not the strings pointed by it
*_dup() makes a copy of structure plus all included strings inside.

*_copy() versions can be thus dangerous. Use *_dup() in doubt.
