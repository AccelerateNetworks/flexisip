Flexisip is general purpose SIP proxy with media capabilities.
It is released under the AGPL v3. Please understand the terms of AGPL in COPYING before deploying it.

Flexisip depends on the following externals:
-oRTP
-mediastreamer2
-sofia-sip

- autotools, libtool

Optionally it also depends on:
- net-snmp
- odbc
- hiredis
- protobuf


To configure Flexisip, copy and modify file flexisip.conf.sample to flexisip.conf in directory <prefix>/etc/flexisip


ODBC
--------------------
Enable pooling in odbcinst.ini and use a thread safe driver.
Use ODBCINI and ODBCSYSINI environement variable to override ini files location.
The connection string defined in authentication section of flexisip.conf may use
either a DSN or a DSN-less connection string.

Example odbcinst.ini file:
[MySQL]
Description = MySQL driver
Driver     = /usr/lib/odbc/libmyodbc.so
Setup      = /usr/lib/odbc/libodbcmyS.so
CPTimeout       = 120
Debug       = 0
Threading       = 1
DontDLClose = 1
[ODBC]
#Trace      = Yes
TraceFile       = /tmp/sql.log
#ForceTrace     = Yes
Pooling     = Yes



Developer notes:
---------------------

With sofia-sip, you have the choice between msg_dup and msg_copy,
sip_from_dup and sip_from_copy etc...
The difference isn't well documented in sofia-sip documentation.
However it is important to understand that
*_copy() just makes a copy of the structure, not the strings pointed by it
*_dup() makes a copy of structure plus all included strings inside.

*_copy() versions can be thus dangerous. Use *_dup() in doubt.
