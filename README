Flexisip is general purpose SIP proxy with media capabilities.
It is released under the AGPL v3. Please understand the terms of AGPL in COPYING before deploying it.

Flexisip depends on the following externals:
-oRTP
-mediastreamer2
-sofia-sip 

SofiaSIP needs to patched with sofia patches from patches/ directory of flexisip sources when running flexisip on several interfaces or when running several instances of same transport type (ex: 2 tcp transport on two different ports).

- autotools, libtool

Optionally it also depends on:
- net-snmp
- odbc
- hiredis
- protobuf


To configure Flexisip, copy and modify file flexisip.conf.sample to flexisip.conf in directory <prefix>/etc/flexisip


ODBC
--------------------
Enable pooling in odbc.ini and use a thread safe driver.
Use ODBCINI and ODBCSYSINI environement variable to override ini files location.
The connection string defined in authentication section of flexisip.conf may use
either a DSN or a DSN-less connection string.

Example odbc.ini file:
[myodbc3]
Driver       = /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/odbc/libmyodbc.so
Description  = MySQL ODBC 3.51 Driver DSN
Server       = localhost
Port         =
User         = user
Password     = password
Database     = flexisip
Option       = 4
Socket       =



Developer notes:
---------------------

With sofia-sip, you have the choice between msg_dup and msg_copy,
sip_from_dup and sip_from_copy etc...
The difference isn't well documented in sofia-sip documentation.
However it is important to understand that
*_copy() just makes a copy of the structure, not the strings pointed by it
*_dup() makes a copy of structure plus all included strings inside.

*_copy() versions can be thus dangerous. Use *_dup() in doubt.
