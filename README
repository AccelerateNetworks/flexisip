Flexisip is general purpose SIP proxy with media capabilities.
It is released under the AGPL v3. Please understand the terms of AGPL in COPYING before deploying it.

Flexisip depends on the following externals:
-oRTP
-mediastreamer2
-sofia-sip


To configure Flexisip, copy and modify file flexisip.conf.sample to flexisip.conf in directory <prefix>/etc/flexisip




Developer notes:
---------------------

With sofia-sip, you have the choice between msg_dup and msg_copy,
sip_from_dup and sip_from_copy etc...
The difference isn't well documented in sofia-sip documentation.
However it is important to understand that
*_copy() just makes a copy of the structure, not the strings pointed by it
*_dup() makes a copy of structure plus all included strings inside.

*_copy() versions can be thus dangerous. Use *_dup() in doubt.
