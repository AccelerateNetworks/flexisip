Flexisip logging is handled by the Boost Log v1 library.

BoostLog v1 was not and official Boost library.
As a consequence it is not included in distributions.

The patches in this directory are needed to make it available on
Debian 6 (squeeze) and Centos 6.


Note that BoostLog v2 is scheduled for inclusion in Boost 1.54.
